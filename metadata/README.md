# LeviatanCode Metadata System

This metadata folder contains comprehensive analysis and documentation for every file in the LeviatanCode application. The structure mirrors the main application architecture to provide AI systems with complete context for expert-level debugging and development assistance.

## Purpose

Each file in the main application has a corresponding metadata file that provides:

- **Purpose**: What the file does and why it exists
- **Dependencies**: All imports, exports, and relationships
- **Object Intent**: The intention behind classes, functions, and variables
- **Architecture Context**: How the file fits into the overall system
- **Debugging Information**: Common issues and troubleshooting tips
- **AI Insights**: Specific guidance for AI systems working with this code

## Structure

The metadata folder follows the same directory structure as the main application:

```
metadata/
├── client/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   └── ...
├── server/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   └── ...
├── shared/
├── scripts/
└── ...
```

## How to Use

1. **For AI Debugging**: Read the corresponding metadata file to understand the purpose and context of any source file
2. **For Development**: Use metadata files to understand dependencies and architecture decisions
3. **For Maintenance**: Refer to common issues and troubleshooting sections

## Metadata File Format

Each metadata file contains:

```markdown
# [File Name] Metadata

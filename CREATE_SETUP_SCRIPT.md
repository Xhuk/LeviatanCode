# Create Windows Setup Script Manually

Since the fixed setup script isn't in your local directory yet, here's how to create it:

## Option 1: Create the file manually

1. Create a new file: `scripts/setup-windows-fixed.py`
2. Copy the content from the repository or use the content below

## Option 2: Quick creation via Command Prompt

```bash
# Create scripts directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir scripts

# Create the file (then paste content)
notepad scripts\setup-windows-fixed.py
```

## Option 3: Use the simplified version

For immediate setup, you can use the existing validator:

```bash
python scripts/windows-complete-test.py
```

This will test your current setup and identify any remaining issues.

## If you don't have any setup files

Run these commands to check your current state:

```bash
# Check if basic files exist
dir package.json
dir .env
dir scripts

# Install dependencies manually
npm install

# Test database connection
npm run test:db

# Start development server
npm run windev
```

## Getting the Latest Files

To get all the latest setup files, you can:

1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Or download the specific files from the repository
3. Or manually create them using the content from the documentation

The key file you need is `scripts/setup-windows-fixed.py` which contains the Windows-compatible setup script without Unicode issues.

# Skip Database Setup - Quick Solution

Since your database tables are already created, you can skip the migration step and continue with the setup.

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# Stop the current hanging process (Ctrl+C)

# Run the quick setup that skips database migration
python scripts\quick-setup-skip-db.py

# Or manually complete the setup
npm install
npm run windev
```

## Alternative Manual Steps:

```bash
# 1. Test database connection directly
npm run test:db

# 2. Start the development server  
npm run windev

# 3. Access the application
# http://localhost:5005
```

## If Scripts Don't Exist:

Add these to your package.json under "scripts":

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "windev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development PORT=5005 tsx server/index.ts",
    "test:db": "node scripts/test-db.js",
    "test:ai": "node scripts/test-ai.js"
  }
}
```

## Quick Validation:

```bash
# Test everything is working
python scripts\windows-complete-test.py
```

The database migration step can hang if tables already exist. The quick setup script will configure everything else you need to run the application successfully.

# Overview

LeviatanCode is a comprehensive web-based development environment that can run and debug various programming languages and frameworks (Vite, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.). It provides an IDE-like interface for importing, managing, and executing projects, enhanced with AI-powered assistance for program execution and debugging. Key capabilities include intelligent project analysis, automatic setup detection, AI-powered debugging, and comprehensive documentation generation. Users can import projects from files or Git repositories, and the AI automatically analyzes the codebase to determine optimal running and debugging strategies.

The system features production-ready components such as robust security middleware, secure session management, global error handling, and secure file upload mechanisms. It also includes an advanced agent system with interactive windows for terminal, file analysis, web preview, system monitoring, and database console, alongside a comprehensive Git management system.
